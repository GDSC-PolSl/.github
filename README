# Google Developers Student Clubs - Our University Chapter
We are a student organization part of a global initiative by Google called Google Developers Student Clubs (GDSC). Our GDSC is a university-based community group for students interested in Google developer technologies. We welcome students from all undergraduate or graduate programs who have an interest in growing as a developer.

## What We Do
By joining our GDSC, students have the opportunity to grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their community. We aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice, providing real-world experience and opportunities to apply the skills learned in the classroom.
